# AS_stock-price-prediction
Machine learning model that predicts stock prices from pre-existing stock data & feature engineering

This project was created as part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate my skills in data science and machine learning. It
reflects my interest in applying technical knowledge to real-world problems and showcases my ability to build end-to-end
solutions from acquiring data to evaluating, testing, and building models.

 Features

- Real-time data fetching from Yahoo Finance
- Feature engineering: lagged prices, moving averages, volatility
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Linear regression model training and evaluation
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual prices

---

Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming
- Data science workflow: feature engineering, model training, evaluation
- Time-series analysis
- Regression modeling
- Data visualization with Matplotlib
- Debugging and iterative development

---

Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

*Some planning and brainstorming support was provided by AI tools, but all implementation and written code was completely
done by me for learning purposes.*
